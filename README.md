  Lightning: Gorgeous, bright bolts, crackling across the sky and crashing down in thick veins on all sides. Long, repeated strikes that brightened the interior like day.
  Wind: She calls the wind. It blows out half the torches and sends orange sparks and embers flying from the braziers.
  Fire: She does not even wait for the wind to die before raising the flames on the last of the torches, high enough to scorch the mural of Queen Elo, the fire breather, where she stands depicted on her gilded brage, burning an attacking fleet of mainland ships to the bottom of Bardon Harbor.
  
  In the folder Lightning Spell is included all three spells.
